        <br><h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>As the world is being digitized, the management system of every organization is getting digitized too. We can lose the document
            accidentally or mistakenly so it is a good solution to digitize the documents. Now it’s a common way to do that through a good
            system that is user friendly on every occasion for digitizing the offline documents. So, we will make a user friendly software
            to make the existing offline documents digitized for the department of finance. The software name is document digitization service.
            The converted digital document will be stored in the database system of the finance department and the system will be capable for
            search and retrieval. There will be three types of user for the system, public, private and the administrators. </p>
        <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
        <p>We have maintained the standard IEEE SRS format for the whole document with the main topics in bold format where the used font size of
            the document is 30 for topics and 18,20 for subsection of topics. The main topics will be divided into 6 sections with prefixes as 
            well as the sub topics like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. We have italicized the special names and technical terminologies.</p>
        <h3 id="1.3">1.3. Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
        <p>The intended audience for this SRS are the project managers, administrators, developers and the Department of finance. The entire SRS 
            is divided into 6 sections and the sections have subsections in each of them. The guidance is to read from section 1 to section 6
            sequentially.The introductory part of the SRS is in the first section. The summary of the full project is given in the 2nd section.
            The user, software, hardware and communication interfaces will be provided in section three. The features of the whole system will
            be summarized in section 4 where the readers can get the ideas about the system features of the software. Section 5 holds the 
            nonfunctional requirements and furthermore requirements of the projects will be given in section 6.
            </p>
        <h3 id="1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
        <p>The main purpose of the software is divided into two sections, firstly we have to maintain the software to digitize all the offline
            documents and secondly integrate the files with the users and further functions. The department of finance will have the benefits 
            from this software mostly because it’s easier to manage the numerous files of so many users online instead of offline paper
            documents. Moreover, through this software system one document of different regions can be accessed quickly in some seconds where
            offline , a document from another region could take a longer period of time to retrieve. The goal of the software is mainly to centralize
            the whole offline system in several regions altogether so that the huge number of files and user’s documents can be managed well and
            easily. Also, in future the new user’s documents can be stored and retrieved well and quick enough to make it easier for both the 
            user and the department of finance. As the world is getting digitized more and more so it is high time for every big company to
            get their documents digitized as there is a big chance to lose the files in offline management systems and it’s also a time 
            consuming thing to do. Our software system will integrate with the new users and also with the existing users to make sure that
            every data is managed well enough to buy the time that would be killed to get the data in the offline system. </p>

        <h2 id="2">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p>In this section, sequentially the overview of the project will be introduced to the readers. The overview includes both the web
            application and the mobile application. It introduces how the software interacts with other systems. This section also introduces
            the functions of the software. Here, the different sections of available functions will be introduced to the readers, like the 
            public or private users will not have the same functions as much as available for an administrator. There will be limitations and
            problems in the system as nothing is perfect and because of this reason the software will have revisions, tests and it will be 
            under a huge time under maintenance so that the problems in the functionalities can be solved and so on.</p>
        <h3 id="2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
        <p>The software is basically for a digitization of existing documents and also for managing these data and taking new users and also
            managing their data through integration in future. The software consists of web application and mobile application(android). 
            The web application will be responsive for all kinds of devices and will be supported in most of the commonly used browsers like 
            mozilla firefox, chrome, safari, opera etc. The web application will take input for documents in necessary formats and through
            the administrator the documents will be integrated with the existing users or the new users in future. In the mobile 
            application it will also guide the user to input the data in necessary format as per need. The mobile application will be the
            connector between the users and the administrator panel. The department of finance will have both the platform for uploading
            existing documents and managing them thoroughly. But the database for both the web application and the mobile application
            will be the same.
            </p>
        <h3 id="2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
        <p>The functions of the software will be divided into 2 sections. 
            1. The first sections will be performing the function of taking the input of the documents in necessary formats. The web
            application or the mobile application will perform functions to let the user or the administrator or the department of finance
            to upload documents. 
            2. The second section of the software functions will be the management and the integration of the future documents with the 
            existing documents. Both the web application and the mobile application will perform such functions that will be understandable
            by the people who will use it. <br>The basic functions of the software are-
            <ul>
                <li>Taking inputs for necessary formats such as pdf.</li>
                <li>Giving the user the ease to upload as many as files they need to upload.</li>
                <li>Having good indexing to manage the documents for further retrieval.</li>
                <li>Managing the connection between the database and the application.</li>
                <li>Giving the user a good enough gesture about managing his/her profile such as uploading an avatar as the user likes,
                     setting own username. Password etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="images/diagram_2.2.jpg" alt="diagram">
        <h3 id="2.3">2.3 User classes and characteristics</h3>
        <p>There are three types of users of the platform. The administrator, the finance department and then the private/public users.
            The web application and mobile application will have managed the documents that will be uploaded by the finance department
            and the other users in future. The system will be eligible to merge and integrate the digitize the old documents with
            the new documents. There will be certain sections and data that will be accessible to specific type of users and the 
            respective accessibility will be managed by the administrator.
        </p>
        <h3 id="2.4">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
        <p>
            Operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac
            Requirements for devices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile: Android 10.0 or later</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Database and APIs: MySQL and Rest API</li>
                        <li>Database API level: 29 or 30</li>
                        <li>RAM: Minimum 1 GB</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Web: A computer with any level of specification with Windows 7,8,10, an internet connection and a modern browser.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
        <p>In our case of web application, the project has a constraint, internet connection. Without an internet connection the administrator
            will lose the control over the application, the department of finance can’t upload documents and the other users also can’t upload
            or see any document relative to their profile as the internet connection is necessary to keep a connection between the database
            server and the application in order to send or receive any kind of requests. In the case of mobile application, the minimum
            required android version is 10.0, so lower android versions might result out of the problem of installation or improper 
            functionality. So, the internet connection and the android version is two of the constraints in the system.</br>
            In the design, we will use our own database for all the documents to be uploaded. For security and privacy reasons, only the
            administrator and the department of finance will have access to all the documents but the users can only view the documents they
            will be given access to. The language of the whole system will be English.
        </p>
        <h3 id="2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
        <p>User’s queries, FAQ and any other necessary tutorial or help messages will be provided in the home page or in any specific section of
             the system.
        </p>
        <h3 id="2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>One assumption is that the mobile application will be running in a mobile that has a good camera. Otherwise, it may occur that the 
            pictures that are taken with the mobile phone will not be good enough to make everything visible in the pdf document.</br>
            Another assumed factor is that the web application will be run in a browser that supports all the features that will exist in our system.</br>
            There will not be any reuse of code from any source, all the functions will be provided by us.
        </p>
        <h2 id="3">3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <h3 id="3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>For the web application, the user interface is the main interface of the application. For general data flow the dashboard and for the communication
            system we will have a notification panel.</br> These are some views for the users.</p>
        </p>
        <div class="home">
            <img src="images/1.JPG" alt="homepage">
        </div>
        <div class="login">
            <img src="images/2.JPG" alt="homepage while login">
        </div>
        <div class="profile">
            <img src="images/3.JPG" alt="profile">
        </div>
        <div><br><br></div>
        <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Basically, we will need an internet connection with the device that we are willing to connect to the application and run it. Then we will need a
            scanner for the computer to scan the documents and upload it and for mobile devices we will need a built-in camera for scanning the documents 
            and uploading it. We will be needing the access to the camera from the application to use the camera for scanning. The hardware needs do not seek
            more than the actual existing, natural components.
        </p>
        <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
        <p>We will be using JAVA and REST API. We will use Django, html, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and python for the web application. We will also use MySQL for
            the database.
        </p>
        <h3 id="3.4">3.4 Communication Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The database and both of the web and mobile application should be connected through an internet connection. The users, department of finance and
            also the administrator will have to be connected to the internet to send or receive any kind of requests to the system. The internet connection
            might be wireless, cable, satellite or cellular etc.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. System Feature begins. -->
        <h2 id="4">4. Systems Features</h2>
        <p>The features stated below are the core building blocks for the Document Digitization Service. Although, 
            these are not the only features that the app contains. Other small 
            but crucial features such as using third party authentication for login are 
            omitted from this section due to its trivial nature.</p>

    <p> 
        <br>1. Data from the database will never be transmitted to unauthenticated sources.</li>
        <br>2. The system will never disclose administrator information to users that are (specific roles such as the employee of the finance department )not authorized to see it.</li>
        <br>3. The user accounts have only alpha and numeric keys that are allowed in the username and password field.</li>
        <br>4. The database must be encrypted at rest.
    </p>
    <h3 id="5.4">5.4  Software Quality Attributes</h3>
        
    <br><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Database is normalized so  that user can easily understand the functions of the system or not.<br>
    <br><strong>Availability :</strong> As the system will be hosted in cloud servers it will be available all the time for users the web application will be available for 24/7 hours.<br>

    <br><strong> Correctness:</strong>  The system will pull appropriate information from the original document  and  use OCR  to provide accurate information based on the users request- upload document ,update.the original files never be replaceable.<br>
    <br><strong>Maintainability :</strong>  The system increases the software maintainability by reducing its complexity. keeping the server protected and updated  before something goes wrong. have a much larger memory capacity than a regular system because they have more RAM. Having more memory, requires having higher quality parts to support that high storage capacity.<br>

    <br><strong>Flexibility:</strong>The application has more functions,make it flexible. like the system will upload new files,update,search previous files, and have no limits in the index field. The system ought to search data such as index, filename, date, author name, uploader name.the system can Scan ning, indexing, unfastening and refastening, Scanned images will be saved using the industry standards version.<br>
    <br> <strong>Reliability : </strong>the software system offers administrators enterprise control over system configuration and application settings – all in a dashboard that you can use to streamline authentication, asset protection, and operational control. 
    <br>
