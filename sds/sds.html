        <br><h2 id="1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3 id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>This software design specification is made with the purpose of laying out the software architecture and design of the Document 
            Digitization Service in detail with all the data, architectural, interface and component level designs. 
            The document will render the developers an insight in meeting client’s needs effectively and efficiently. 
            Moreover the document facilitates communication and understanding of the system by providing several views 
            of the system design. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2">1.2 Document Conventions</h3>
        <p>The document maintained the typical document conventions with the main topics being 
            bold and have a font size of 30 then sub-topics are 
            bold also with the smaller font size of 20 than the main topic. 
            The sub topics are numbered with main topic number as a 
            prefix such as for 1st main topic the sub topics are prefixes as 1.1,1.2,1.3 and so on.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.3">1.3. Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
        <p>The intended audience of this software design specification or SDS are the project managers and developers of 
            the document digitization service as it will serve as the instruction for all the development requirements. 
            There will be several technical terminologies and diagrams so it would be wise for the readers to gain the
             knowledge about the topics that will be use here in sds.  
            </p>
        <h3 id="2">2 Architectural Design Pattern</h3>
        <p>The ‘Document Digitization Service’ application, both mobile app and web app, will be using 
            the Model View Template (MVT) software design architecture. 
            The entire design has broke down into three components   and each component has a specific purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Model:</strong> Model acts as an interface for our data and is basically the logical structure 
                behind the entire web application which is represented by a database here we will be using MySql.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>View: </strong>View executes the business logic and 
                interacts with the Model and renders the template. It accepts HTTP requests 
                and then returns HTTP responses.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Templates: </strong>Templates are used to specify a structure for an output. 
                Data can be populated in a template using placeholders. It defines how the data is presented. 
                An example is a Generic list view that we can use to display a set of records from the database
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Advantages of using MVT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Less coupled.
            </li>
            <li>
                Suitable for small to large-scale applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Easy to Modify.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>MVT Architecture Pattern</h3>
        <img src="images/MVT.png" alt="MVT">
    <br>
    <h3 id="3">3 Description of Design Components</h3>
    <p>
        The entire design can be broken down into two components one is server side and another is client side. 
    </p>
    <h4 id="3.1">3.1 Server Side:</h4>
    <p>
        The whole server will taken care of the following ways:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Security System: The users will have all the security measurements so that they can safely use our system 
            without being exposed to anyone so much easily. In addition they can secure their file and folder by the lock feature 
            so that without a password
            the user himself/herself can’t access his/her locked file and folders. In addition the system 
            has some policy for brute force attacks.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If a user remains idle for 15 minutes then the user will be automatically logged out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After consecutive 3 failed login attempts the system will block the account of the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reset password would be done by the assigned administrator using the administration panel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only alphanumeric keys are allowed in the username and password field.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Backup System: The administrators can take the backup of the system 
                so that any unexpected situation can be handled without losing the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recovery System: From the backuped system the system can be recover at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintenance and Technical Support: The system would have a better Maintenance and Technical Support policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Capabilities: The system would be capable of uploading a sing and bulk files and can store approximately 3.5 million files
            </li>
            <li>
                Notification management: The system would be able to send notification to the user for any 
                kind of modification, update and request access with following 2 condition as well:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The system should be capable to send email notification in every
                        routed task.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system should be capable view real-time notifications in the dashboard
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Reports Management:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The system should be capable of counting all the uploaded records by folder or user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system should be capable of counting all the pages in every record uploaded.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Search and Retrieval Management: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The system should be capable of searching data 
                        such as index, file name, date, author name, uploader name, 
                        document type and content of the scanned document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system should have an advanced content search that can search optical character recognition (ocr) 
                        of the scanned documents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system should have a filtering in search result to easily track the documents.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4 id="3.2">3.2 Client Side:</h4>
    <p>
        By this the client should be able to visit
         through different platforms like web and android.but whenever the client visits they see the same things and same functionalities.
         <ol>
             <li>
                Login: At first the user sees the login page.where they have to put their username and password .if the information matches with the database then see her own dashboard.if user has not
                 been registered yet he will see the message that you are not registered yet..And the user can also log in through Googl
             </li>
             
             <li>

                Registration: The registration of a user can only be done by the administrator.
             </li>
         </ol>

            <h3 id="8">8. Implementation Plan</h3>
            <p> At first we will build UI for both  the mobile app  and web app. Muhtasin Mashrur Adit will work on the web app’s UI and Tamalika
            Bakshi will work on the mobile app’s UI. Then the system will be developed by the django framework  and python with a relational
            database here we will be using mysql. The system will be designed by MD. ABU AMMAR. The web app and mobile app both would be connected
            to the same system. The web app would be connected to the system by the django framework itself and the mobile app would be connected 
            to the system via rest API which would be designed by Muhtasin Mashrur Adit. Any third party system can access the system via API after
            get authenticated by authentication API. This part of the design would be managed by Tamalika Bakshi again.</p>
